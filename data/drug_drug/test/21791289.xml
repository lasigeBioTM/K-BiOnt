    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d168.s1" text="Inhibitory interneurons across diverse brain regions commonly exhibit spontaneous spiking activity, even in the absence of external stimuli. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d168.s2" text="It is not well understood how stimulus-evoked inhibition can be distinguished from background inhibition arising from spontaneous firing. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d168.s3" text="We found that noradrenaline simultaneously reduced spontaneous inhibitory inputs and enhanced evoked inhibitory currents recorded from principal neurons of the mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d168.s4" text="Together, these effects produced a large increase in signal-to-noise ratio for stimulus-evoked inhibition. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d168.s5" text="Surprisingly, the opposing effects on background and evoked currents could both be attributed to noradrenergic silencing of spontaneous spiking in glycinergic interneurons. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d168.s6" text="During spontaneous firing, glycine release was decreased due to strong short-term depression. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d168.s7" text="Elimination of background spiking relieved inhibitory synapses from depression and thereby enhanced stimulus-evoked inhibition. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d168.s8" text="Our findings illustrate a simple yet powerful neuromodulatory mechanism to shift the balance between background and stimulus-evoked signals."/>
