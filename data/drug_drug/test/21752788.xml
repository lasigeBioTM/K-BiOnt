    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s1" text="Cervical incomplete spinal cord injuries often lead to severe and persistent impairments of sensorimotor functions and are clinically the most frequent type of spinal cord injury. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s2" text="Understanding the motor impairments and the possible functional recovery of upper and lower extremities is of great importance. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s3" text="Animal models investigating motor dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury are rare. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s4" text="We analysed the differential spontaneous recovery of fore- and hindlimb locomotion by detailed kinematic analysis in adult rats with unilateral C4/C5 hemisection, a lesion that leads to the Brown-S  quard syndrome in humans. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s5" text="The results showed disproportionately better performance of hindlimb compared with forelimb locomotion; "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s6" text="hindlimb locomotion showed substantial recovery, whereas the ipsilesional forelimb remained in a very poor functional state. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s7" text="Such a differential motor recovery pattern is also known to occur in monkeys and in humans after similar spinal cord lesions. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s8" text="On the lesioned side, cortico-, rubro-, vestibulo- and reticulospinal tracts and the important modulatory serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic fibre systems were interrupted by the lesion. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s9" text="In an attempt to facilitate locomotion, different monoaminergic agonists were injected intrathecally. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s10" text="Injections of specific serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists in the chronic phase after the spinal cord lesion revealed remarkable, although mostly functionally negative, modulations of particular parameters of hindlimb locomotion. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s11" text="In contrast, forelimb locomotion was mostly unresponsive to these agonists. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s12" text="These results, therefore, show fundamental differences between fore- and hindlimb spinal motor circuitries and their functional dependence on remaining descending inputs and exogenous spinal excitation. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d186.s13" text="Understanding these differences may help to develop future therapeutic strategies to improve upper and lower limb function in patients with incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries."/>
