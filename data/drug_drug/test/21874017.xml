    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d148.s2" text="We discovered a previously unknown partner of oligophrenin-1, Rev-erb  , a nuclear receptor that represses the transcription of circadian oscillators. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d148.s3" text="We found that oligophrenin-1 interacts with Rev-erb   in the mouse brain, causing it to locate to dendrites, reducing its repressor activity and protecting it from degradation. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d148.s4" text="Our results indicate the presence of a circadian oscillator in the hippocampus, involving the clock gene Bmal1 (also known as Arntl), that is modulated by Rev-erb   and requires oligophrenin-1 for normal oscillation. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d148.s5" text="We also found that synaptic activity induced Rev-erb   localization to dendrites and spines, a process that is mediated by AMPA receptor activation and requires oligophrenin-1. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d148.s6" text="Our data reveal new interactions between synaptic activity and circadian oscillators, and delineate a new means of communication between nucleus and synapse that may provide insight into normal plasticity and the etiology of intellectual disability."/>
