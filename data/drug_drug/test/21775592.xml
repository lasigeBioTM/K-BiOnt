    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s1" text="The well established anatomy of the cerebellar cortex has led to suggestions that cerebellar molecular layer interneurons laterally inhibit Purkinje cells. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s2" text="In support of the anatomical predictions, on-beam excitation and off-beam inhibition of Purkinje cells have been shown to occur when the surface of the cerebellum is electrically excited. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s3" text="Patchy excitation of Purkinje cells with flanking inhibition of sagittally oriented Purkinje cells have also been demonstrated following peripheral stimulation in vivo. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s4" text="To extend these observations, we mapped the functional connectivity between granule cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells in rats. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s5" text="Patches of granule cells were asynchronously activated by photostimulation to mimic their excitation by a mossy fiber as it occurs in vivo. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s6" text="We found with remarkable consistency that, in the sagittal orientation, granule cells elicit a stereotypic set of responses. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s7" text="Granule cells immediately underneath a Purkinje cell provide pure excitation. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s8" text="Granule cells positioned 340-400   m laterally provided pure inhibition, consistent with the lateral inhibition proposed earlier. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s9" text="The net effect of exciting granule cells in between these two extremes was to provide a systematic change in the response of Purkinje cells, from net excitation to net inhibition moving laterally from the Purkinje cell. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s10" text="In contrast to the sagittal orientation, in the coronal orientation the organization of Purkinje cell responses with granule cell activation was remarkably different. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d155.s11" text="Independent of the location of granule cells, within the 480   m lateral distance examined, molecular layer interneurons reduced the strength of granule cell inputs to Purkinje cells to a comparable extent."/>
