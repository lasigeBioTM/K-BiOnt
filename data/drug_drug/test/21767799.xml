    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d226.s1" text="The purpose of this cluster-randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of quality circles (QCs) working either with general data-based feedback or with an open benchmark within the field of asthma care and drug-drug interactions."/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d226.s2" text="Twelve QCs, involving 96 general practitioners from 85 practices, were randomised. "/>

    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d226.s7" text="Outcome measures included health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction with treatment, asthma severity and number of potentially inappropriate drug combinations as well as the general practitioners' satisfaction in relation to the performance of the QC.
